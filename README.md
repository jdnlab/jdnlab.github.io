I architect, automate, and secure resilient technical infrastructure, with proven experience in large cloud service provider and financial institutions. My passion is building systems that are not only scalable and cost-effective but also secure by design. I have significant interests in Linux systems administration, Python code development, virtualized infrastructure, and security.

## What I Do

- **Infrastructure Engineering (Cloud and Data Center):** Designing, deploying, and optimizing Linux-based systems up to thousands of servers
- **Systems Automation:** Developing software code that eliminates manual operations toil, such as system provisioning, server fleet maintenance, or database migrations
- **Security Automation:** Building and orchestrating security detection and response using custom Python tooling and/or commercial SOAR platforms
- **SRE & Observability:** Implementing SRE practices to improve system reliability, from reducing MTTR with automated responses to building robust monitoring systems

## Selected Projects

### Critical Data Center Power Telemetry

- Prevented data center outages by building a custom, rack-level power (PDU) telemetry solution for 30+ racks / 1K+ servers
- Collaborated with Data Center Engineering to quantify kW draw of 'hot shards' allowing rebalancing of physical server hardware

### Simplified Linux Authentication

- Proved standard tools ([sssd](https://sssd.io/), [realmd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/realmd/), [kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)) resulted in lower complexity and TCO relative to costly vendor solutions
- Proactively reduced potential issues via extensive fault testing e.g. network partition events

### Compromised Credentials Detection

- Enabled DFIR teams to investigate and remediate compromised credentials in seconds via building foundational Python code leveraging LDAPv3
- Overcame integration hurdles with on-premises IAM platforms such as [Oracle ODSEE](https://www.oracle.com/security/identity-management/technologies/directory-server-enterprise-edition/) and [NetIQ Identity Manager](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager/)

### Auto-Remediation for Non-Compliant AWS Infrastructure

- Prevented insecure AWS cloud deployments by contributing Python components for a security compliance engine built on AWS Lambda
- Lowered manual deployment toil for this service across many AWS accounts via standard IaC tools (Terraform, Jenkins)
- Team's efforts were [showcased at AWS re:Inforce 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4jxJJYiVY0)

### Containerized Cyber Operations Range (Research)
- Demonstrated the viability of using lightweight application virtualization over 'full' virtualization (KVM, VMware, etc) for cyber exercises
- Architected and deployed the initial iteration of bare metal Linux, Kubernetes, and network infrastructure 
- Contributed to a research paper presented at [National Cyber Summit 2017 - University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://louis.uah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=cyber-summit)

## Technical Skills

- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Troubleshooting, Storage, Containers, Networking, Monitoring)
- **Languages & Scripting:** Python, Bash, Terraform, Ansible, Chef
- **Cloud & Virtualization:** AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda), Docker, Kubernetes
- **Security & Monitoring:** XSOAR, Vault, Splunk, Datadog
