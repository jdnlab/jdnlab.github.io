## Senior Systems Engineer / SRE

I architect, automate, and secure resilient technical infrastructure. My passion is building systems that are not only scalable and cost-effective but also secure by design. Specifically, I have significant interest in Linux, Python, and AWS.

## üöÄ What I Do

- **‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure Engineering (Cloud and Data Center):** Designing, deploying, and optimizing Linux-based systems up to thousands of servers.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Internal Tooling:** Developing software tools that eliminate manual toil, such as vulnerability remediation pipelines and digital forensics and incident response automation.
- **üîí Security Automation:** Building and orchestrating security responses with custom Python tooling and commercial SOAR platforms.
- **üõ†Ô∏è SRE & Observability:** Implementing SRE practices to improve system reliability, from reducing MTTR with automated diagnostics to building robust monitoring systems.

## üíº Featured Projects

### Critical Data Center Power Telemetry

- Prevented data center outages by deploying rack-level power (PDU) telemetry for 30+ racks / 1K+ nodes across 3 data centers
- Collaborated with Data Center Engineering to quantify kW draw of 'hot shards' allowing for physical server rebalancing

### Simplified IAM for Linux

- Proved standard Linux tools ([sssd](https://sssd.io/), [realmd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/realmd/), [kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)) resulted in lower complexity and TCO compared to costly vendor solutions
- Proactively reduced potential issues thru extensive fault testing (e.g. network partition events, [ccache](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html))

### Compromised Credential Detection

- Enabled DFIR teams to investigate compromised credentials in seconds via building foundational Python code leveraging LDAPV3
- Overcame challenges with on-premises platforms such as custom [Oracle ODSEE](https://www.oracle.com/security/identity-management/technologies/directory-server-enterprise-edition/) and [NetIQ Identity Manager](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager/)

### Auto-Remediation for Noncompliant Infrastructure

- Contributed Python components for a AWS security compliance engine built on AWS Lambda, [which was showcased at AWS re:Inforce 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4jxJJYiVY0)
- Automated manual deployment toil across many AWS accounts via IaC tools (Terraform, Jenkins).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Troubleshooting, Storage, Containers, Networking, Monitoring)
- **Languages & Scripting:** Python, Bash
- **Cloud & IaC:** AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda), Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack
- **Security & Monitoring:** XSOAR, Vault, Splunk, Datadog
- **Networking**: TCP/UDP, IPv4, DNS, HTTP, SSL/TLS, LDAP, Kerberos, SNMPv3
